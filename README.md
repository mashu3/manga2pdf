## Overview
This Python script is specifically designed to convert manga and comic files, including various formats such as zip, epub, and directories containing image files, to PDF format.

The resulting PDF files are optimized to resemble Japanese manga in terms of page layout and direction. By default, the script uses a "TwoPageRight" page layout that displays two pages side-by-side for a spread view, and a "R2L" (right-to-left) reading direction that is commonly used in Japanese manga.

## Requirement
The script uses the Python libraries **[img2pdf](https://pypi.org/project/img2pdf/)** and **[pikepdf](https://pypi.org/project/pikepdf/)** to do the conversion.
Moreover, it uses **[lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/)** to read the EPUB files and **[rarfile](https://pypi.org/project/rarfile/)** to read the RAR archive files, and **[mobi](https://pypi.org/project/mobi/)** to handle both MOBI and AZW files.

It requires the installation of these packages in order to work properly.

**Note**
- This script can only handle DRM-free fixed-layout EPUB, MOBI, and AZW3 files.
- Please ensure that the image files you input are named in numerical order according to their page sequence. For example, `page_01.jpg`, `page_02.jpg`, `page_03.jpg`, and so on, or `001.jpg`, `002.jpg`, `003.jpg`, and so on. This will ensure that the pages are converted and compiled in the correct order.

## Usage
The program can be executed from the command line with the following options:
- The `input_path` argument is the path to the input file. To execute the Python script correctly, specify the `input_path` argument as the path to the input file containing manga or comic images in one of the supported formats, such as `zip`, `cbz`, `rar`, `cbr`, `epub`, `mobi`, `azw`, or a directory containing images in formats such as `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, or `bmp`.
- The `output_path` argument is the path to the output PDF file. To use the script, simply run the Python script with the path to the input file or directory as the argument. If the `--output` option is not specified, the output file name will be automatically generated based on the name of the input file or directory.
- The `pagelayout` parameter can take in the following values:
    - `SinglePage` -> Single page display
    - `OneColumn` -> Enable scrolling
    - `TwoPageLeft` -> Spread view
    - `TwoColumnLeft` -> Spread view with scrolling
    - (default) `TwoPageRight` -> Separate Cover, Spread View
    - `TwoColumnRight` -> Separate Cover, Scrolling Spread View
- The `pagemode` parameter can take in the following values:
    - (default) `UseNone` -> Neither document outline nor thumbnail images visible
    - `UseOutlines` -> Document outline visible
    - `UseThumbs` -> Thumbnail images visible
    - `FullScreen` -> Full-screen mode
    - `UseOC` -> Optional content group panel visible
    - `UseAttachments` -> Attachments panel visible
- The `direction` parameter can take in the following values:
    - `L2R` -> Left Binding
    - (default) `R2L` -> Right Binding

By default, the page layout is set to `TwoPageRight` and the reading direction to `R2L`, which are suitable for Japanese manga.

The `-j` or `--jpeg` option converts images to JPEG format before including them in the output PDF file, resulting in a smaller file size. Similarly, the `-g` or `--grayscale` option can be used to convert images to grayscale and reduce the size of the resulting PDF file. The program outputs the converted image in the specified format and compresses the PDF file accordingly.

**Note**
- When the original image is already in the JPEG format, using the `-j` or `--jpeg` option will have no effect. Similarly, if the original image is already grayscale, using the `-g` or `--grayscale` option will have no effect. Also, if none of these options are used, the resulting PDF file will not be compressed.

There is a possibility that the script may not be able to handle files in unexpected formats correctly, which may result in errors or unexpected output.

```
- To convert `my_manga.epub` to `my_manga_spread.pdf` with a spread view and right binding:
```
$ manga2pdf my_manga.epub -o my_manga_spread.pdf
```
- To convert `my_comic.epub` to `my_comic.pdf` with a TwoPage view and left binding:
```
